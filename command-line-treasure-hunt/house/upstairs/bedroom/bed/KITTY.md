# It's a kitty!

You found a KITTY.md in the bed/ directory! How soft and cuddly. Congratulations!

But it looks lonely. Why don't you make it a DOGGIE.md here in bed/?
	1. Use the ``echo`` command and redirect to create a new file containing the text "There is a dog in the bed cuddling with the cat!"
		```
		echo “There is a dog in the bed cuddling with the cat!“> DOGGIE.md
		```

	2. Use the ``ls`` command to check that the file DOGGIE.md exists within the bed library
 	3. Use the ``cat`` command to review that the text is in the file. 
  
  If the text is there, congratulations! You have finished the first task and the cat is not lonely anymore :)
